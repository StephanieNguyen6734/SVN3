            <p>Sexual Assault is performing sexual acts without the permission or consent of the other party. 
                Sexaul assault is not just rape, it can be unwanted touching or forcing the other party to do 
                sexual acts. There are different legal defintions of rape depending on each state so check your state to have a concise definition. The definition of rape given by the FBI is,
                “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” </p>

                    <p>Sexual Assault is a problem affecting everyone. Statistics show that 80,600 inmates were sexually assaulted, 60,000 children were sexually abused, 433,648 Americans(12 years old and older) were sexually assaulted, and 18,900 soldiers serving in the military were sexually assualted ( in 1 year).
                        Also, 3% of American men have experienced an attempted rape in their life. Even though out of 1 of every 10 people, are male survivors, the alarming numbers of rape for women are 9 out of every 10 survivors. Rape happens to all people of genders, but it is disproportionately greater in females.

                            <p>I know it can seem difficult to talk and help a survivor, but trust me it's better 
                                to take action then stay silent. Remember to give words of encouragement and praise them if they come to you. They trusted you as a human being where they feel safe enough to come forward and share their story.
                                Never victim blame, such as "Why were you wearing that? You were asking for it." That mentality is already engrained into most survivors deeming that it is their fault so, it is crucial for you to support 
                                them. If someone you know seems unsure to talk about their story then it's good to give them some space, but it's also good to let them 
                                know that you are always there when they feel comfortable opening up.

                                    <p>I wrote this paragraph to help empower survivors if they needed something to help rebuild their confidence. Your clothes, location, and time, have nothing to 
                                        do with why you were sexually assaulted. Don't look at yourself as the problem because the only person to blame is the perpetrator themself. Keep your head up because you are more than a victim, you are a survivor. You've dealt with 
                                        such a traumatizing scenario, and yet look at you, you still are shining beautifully in the eyes of many. Beauty is only defined by your character, so don't let anything else define it. Even though I've never have experienced 
                                        the pain you've gone through, I'm here to help remind you that you are stronger than you think.
